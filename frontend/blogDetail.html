                    My Kindergartener Can Make This Recipe – And I Actually, Genuinely Love It
                    Lindsay Ostrom headshot.
                    It’s a parenting first!

                    I love the idea of matching your kid’s age to a number of goal recipes – for example, when you’re 5
                    years old – you learn how to make 5 recipes. (I got this idea from Nita and Jess at Healthy Happy
                    Eaters
                    – they are wonderful.)

                    My daughter’s favorite dinner is spaghetti, so I thought making it in the Instant Pot might help it
                    feel
                    more manageable:

                    it’s one single pot.
                    no cutting board required.
                    it has higher sides so there’s less splattering.
                    no draining of boiling water.
                    We started making it this way “to help her” but quickly realized… Instant Pot spaghetti is actually
                    kinda special. It’s silky, flavorful, and extra clingy. Makes for an ideal combo with house favorite
                    garlic bread and air fryer broccoli.
                    Personally I love making this with Italian sausage! It has more flavor (you can even skip the salt
                    because the sausage itself has a lot of salt in it). So, sausage is my pick – however, my family
                    loves
                    it with the classic ground beef so that’s what I am including in the recipe.
